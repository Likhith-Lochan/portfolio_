      <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I am a <strong>Software Developer</strong> with 3+ years of experience building scalable, 
  high-performance systems across backend engineering and robotics. At 
  <strong> Svaya Robotics</strong>, I engineered multithreaded communication systems using 
  <strong> C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>ROS2</strong>, including a WebSocket server built with 
  Boost.Beast and a custom ROS–JSON bridge that enabled real-time interaction 
  between robots and web clients.
</p>

<p>
  Previously at <strong>Wipro</strong>, I designed and maintained Java-based microservices using 
  <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, improving backend performance through 
  <strong>Redis</strong> caching and strengthening system reliability with API testing using 
  <strong>JUnit</strong> and <strong>Postman</strong>. I also containerized services with <strong>Docker</strong> to ensure 
  smooth, reproducible deployments.
</p>

<p>
  I am proficient in <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong> with hands-on experience in 
  distributed systems, cloud tools, and real-time communication technologies like 
  <strong>Kafka</strong>. I’m an <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong> and continuously explore new ways 
  to build clean, efficient, and scalable software systems.
</p>

<p>
  I am also actively expanding my expertise into <strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>, 
  working with <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>PyTorch</strong>, and large language models such as 
  <strong>GPT</strong>, <strong>LLaMA</strong>, and <strong>BERT</strong>. I even built and deployed my own 
  Transformer-based Bigram Language Model on <strong>Hugging Face</strong>, deepening my 
  understanding of model architectures, training pipelines, and ML deployment.
</p>

<p>
  I’m now looking to transition into roles where I can combine strong software 
  engineering fundamentals with my growing AI/ML skillset to build intelligent, 
  data-driven systems.
