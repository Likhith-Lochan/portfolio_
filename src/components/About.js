      <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a <strong>software developer</strong> with experience in building secure, scalable, and cloud-integrated backend systems using <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. Currently at <strong>Svaya Robotics</strong>, I focus on designing robust RESTful APIs and implementing secure authentication mechanisms, such as <strong>JWT</strong> and <strong>RBAC</strong>, for a payroll management platform. My work includes cloud integration with <strong>AWS S3</strong> for secure payslip storage and dynamic PDF generation for automated document workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously at <strong>Wipro</strong>, I contributed to microservice development using <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, optimizing backend performance with <strong>Redis</strong> caching and improving API reliability through thorough testing with <strong>JUnit</strong> and <strong>Postman</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m proficient in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>, and have hands-on experience with <strong>Kafka</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and cloud services. I'm passionate about building clean, efficient, and secure systems, and constantly exploring new tools and best practices to improve software performance and maintainability. I’m also <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong> certified.
